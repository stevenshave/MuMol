# µMol
Format for highly compressed small molecules.
The SDF (Structured Data Format) file is arguably the most widely used format for small molecules.  This SDF text format is however, highly inefficient. µMol, or MuMol, is an efficient encoding for the SDF file format.

This repository showcases the use of the µMol package for encoding and decoding from the format.
